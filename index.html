<h1>Zach Morse</h1>

<p>
	I am Zach Morse, originally from Cheyenne, Wyoming but currently residing in Nashville, TN. Previous to joining TIY,
	I was a truck driver, Frac Hand, and professional touring bassist. I am into coding because I enjoy work that combines
	technical know-how applied to creative problems.
